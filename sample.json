Its thick double fur, soft as silk to the touch, glistens with a subtle sheen, inviting admiration and affection. The texture varies from dense and plush on its neck and shoulders to longer and more flowing towards the tail and back."

His calloused hands cradled the prize of his catch, a shimmering silver fish that seemed to glow with an otherworldly light in the morning sun."
